### Hi, I'm Sergio

Fullstack Engineer stronger on backend. I have experience working with different stacks (Java, Spring, Scala, Akka/Cats, Node, React, Nextjs and Typescript).

When I have time, I use to work on side projects for personal tooling.

Pinned repos are the ones I consider good enough to validate my background and tech skills.
