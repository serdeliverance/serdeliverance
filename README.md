### Hi, I'm Sergio

Fullstack Engineer stronger on backend. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (Scala and Java).

My geek interests are Functional Programming, Distributed Systems and building amazing products.

This set of repositories contains mostly ideas, pocs and playgrounds (because, at the of the day, I really enjoy coding).

Pinned repos are the ones I consider good enough to validate my background and tech skills.
