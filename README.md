### Hi, I'm Sergio

Seasoned Fullstack Engineer stronger on backend. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (Scala and Java). Also, I love the Javascript ecosystem (mainly Node, Nestjs and React). My approach is to always use the right tool for the job and being as pragmatic as possible.

My geek interests are Functional Programming, Reactive Programming and Distributed Systems.
