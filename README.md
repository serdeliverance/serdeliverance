### Hi, I'm Sergio

Fullstack engineer with many years of experience. Most of my experience is based on JVM related technologies (such as Scala and Java). Also, I have some frontend experience (Angular/React) and knowledge about other platforms, such as Nodejs. However, my approach is to always use the right tool for the job and being as pragmatic as possible.

My geek interests are Functional Programming, Reactive Programming and Distributed Systems.
